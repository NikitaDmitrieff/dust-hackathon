Assistant: Hello. Let’s get started. What’s the purpose of the form you want to create?

User: it's for my employee to know if like they're satisfied with the job and if they want to move to another location maybe

Assistant: questions, current role or department, and their location preference. Do you also want to collect open feedback or just structured responses?Great.

User: No, I'm good

Assistant: We’ll keep it structured. Next, for satisfaction, do you want a numeric scale, like 1 to 5, or something else?

User: Please, do the best thing you can do.

Assistant: Understood. Let’s go with a clear numeric scale, for example

User: Thank you

Assistant: 1 to 5 for satisfaction. We’ll include fields for current role, department, and preferred new location. We’ll also add a yes/no question for relocation interest. Finally, one optional comment box for any additional thoughts. That covers the essentials.
